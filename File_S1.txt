Fields include:

-strain2: This is always B6
-variant_id: a positive integer ID specifying the variant. Unique to every variant; chromosomes don't share variant_id.
However, this ID is shared across strains.

Although not relevant to this paper's use of the data, in this file, note that there may multiple records per variant if the diplotype of the variant is uncertain; in such a case there is one row per non-zero diplotype probability, and the probabilities add approximately to 1. There also may be multiple rows per variant if a variant is enclosed by more than one gene.

Microarray data

File_S10_MoGene-1_1_libs.zip: The affymetrix library files for the MoGene1.1 exon ST arrays. na34 version.
Used to generate expression matrix across all samples with proper normalization using affymetrix power tools,
as well as to identify probes to mask.
Files include:

  each probe within the CERevision Date 20090608:L matrix

*.pgf (Probe Group File): which indicates the groupings of 
  probes into probesets. 

*.bgp (BackGround Probe file): The bgp files lists the 
  probe IDs for the background probes for use with the
  PM-GCBG intensity method. 

*.ps (ProbeSet list file): This file lists a particular
  set of probesets. This file may be used to process
  only a specific subset of the chip or it may be used to
  call out a special set of probesets on the chip.
  
*.mps (Meta ProbeSet file): This file is used for gene
  level analysis on WT-based Gene and Exon arrays. It lists
  probesets in the PGF file to be merged together to create
  a gene level probeset.

*.qcc (QC Control file): This file lists various controls
  on the chip. It is used by EC to determine which controls
  are listed in the CHP file headers (and by what name they
  are listed) and it also classifies controls into various
  groups for reporting purposes.
