File_S3_Mus_musculus.GRCm38.75.gtf: Exon data (and other genomic features) for BL38.75 in gtf format.
Crucially, this file is used in the code to determine gene locations.
Originally downloaded from ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-75/gtf/mus_musculus/Mus_musculus.GRCm38.75.gtf.gz


File_S4_Snord.zip: The set of all GRCm38.75 Snord regions, with a separate csv file per snord family.
This is essentially used in the code as a list of ensembl ids per snord whose other fields are looked up elsewhere.

Fields include:
-id_with_url: the ensembl id of a given snord region
-name: the snord mgi symbol
-species: mouse (repetitive, could have been removed from the download)

-description: general description of the gene. (Unused)


File_S5_crowley_2015_brain_imprinted_genes.csv: The genes identified as imprinted in Crowley, 2015. As with the snords, the primary field used from this file is the ensembl id. Location and name info  is referenced from elsewhere.

File_S8_2017-02-13_breederLog.csv: The true (as opposed to certain fields in the behavior files) covariates for mice bred in this experiment (e.g., diet, strain, etc). The covariates from this breeding file are considered correct, and take precedence over any identical (in name or meaning) covariates in any of the phenotype files.
Fields include:
-Batch: The breeding batch of this mouse. Can be 1,2, or 3.
-ID: Integer ID of the mouse. 178 unique integer IDs rangeing
-DOB: Mouse date of birth
-Weaned: Mouse date of weaning
-Dam ID: Integer id of this mouse's dam. Note that the id is unique ONLY within a strain. To get a truly unique id, concatenate Dam and Dam ID.
-Dam: Strain of the dam, either NOD or B6
-Dam DOB: Dam date of birth
-Date on Diet: The date the dam went on the experimental diet.
-Dam Age at Diet: Dam's age at time of diet
-Sire ID: The integer id of the sire
-Diet: A string indicating which of the 4 diets the mouse's dam was exposed to. 
-Pipeline: Either 1 or 2, depending on which set of behavioral experiments was performed.
-DOT: Date testing began.
-Age Date: Age of mouse (in days) on the date of testing.

File_S9_behaviorModels: For each (simple) experiment and phenotype within that experiment, the lmer version of the formula used in mediation modelling. Startle PPI models are complicated, so they are specified in the code.

File_S10_cel_files.zip: The CEL files (an affymetrix format) from the Affy 1.1ST exon array, specifiying gene expression scores for every microarray probeset, as measured in every mouse. Each file is named according to the mouse being probed.

File_S11_d_b6.variants.zip: the snp/indel variant positions (and the variant sequences) that vary between NOD and B6. Extracted from ISVdb2.0. Used for masking variants.
Fields include:
-strain1: This is always NOD
-strain2: This is always B6
-variant_id: a positive integer ID specifying the variant. Unique to every variant; chromosomes don't share variant_id.
However, this ID is shared across strains.
-chr: the chromosome of the variant
-pos: positive integer specifying variant position in bp along chromosome.
-transcript_name: the ensembl transcript id (if available) of a transcript affected by the variant.
-gene_name: the name of a gene enclosing the variant.
-allele1: the NOD allele at this position
-allele2: the B6 allele at this position.
-consequence_1: the functional consequence of the NOD allele on transcript_name, with respect to the B6 reference allele. 
-consequence_2: the functional consequence of B6-- "reference".
-prob: the probability that the unphased diplotype of the variant at this position is (allele_1, allele_2) 

Although not relevant to this paper's use of the data, in this file, note that there may multiple records per variant if the diplotype of the variant is uncertain; in such a case there is one row per non-zero diplotype probability, and the probabilities add approximately to 1. There also may be multiple rows per variant if a variant is enclosed by more than one gene.
-transcript_name: the name of a transcript enclosing the variant.

File_S12_behaviorModels.csv: The models (in lmer formula format) employed per behavior, for the most straightforward behaviors; a handful of other behaviors, in particular the PPI related ones, are entirely specified programmatically rather than in a document.

but with default APT params and especially NO masking; used solely for its probeset annotations.
