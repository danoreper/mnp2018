Introduction</h2>
<p>apt-probeset-genotype is a program for making genotype calls from Affymetrix SNP microarrays. It currently implements three different genotype calling algorithms:</p>
<ul>
<li>
BRLMM (pronounced "B-realm") - a model based approach similar to the RLMM (pronounced "realm") model developed by Nusrat Rabbee and Terry Speed but with a Bayesian extension, hence the "B". Currently requires seed genotypes for every SNP and sample analyzed which it obtains via the DM algorithm, hence it requires the presence of MisMatch (MM) probes. [brlmm] </li>
<li>
BRLMM-P - a model-based approach which performs 1-dimensional clustering by fitting a Gaussian mixture model. No requirement for seed genotypes, hence can run on SNP chips without MM probes. BRLMM-P Plus is a variation on this method. [brlmm-p] </li>
<li>
Birdseed (v1) - a model-based clustering method which fits a Gaussian mixture model in 2-dimensional (signalA,signalB) space. Signal processing prior to the EM clustering is as in BRLMM and BRLMM-P. Fitting is performed by Expectation Maximization (EM) and there is no requirement for MM probes. "%birdseed" and "birdseed-v1" are aliased to the same thing as seen below regarding analysis strings. [birdseed-v1 or birdseed] </li>
<li>
Birdseed (v2) - like Birdseed v1 but with improved handling of SNP-specific models. Birdseed v1 uses SNP-specific models as starting points from which to begin EM iteration. In Birdseed v2 the models are used in a pseudo-Bayesian fashion, limiting the possibility of arriving at a genotype clustering that is very different to the supplied models. [birdseed-v2] </li>
<li>
Birdseed (dev) - the most recently incorporated development version of birdseed from The Broad Institute. The actual anlaysis run by the "birdseed-dev" analysis string may change over time as the birdseed method evolves. [birdseed-dev]  </li>
</ul>
<p>APT implements the Birdseed v1 algorithm, developed in collaboration with the Broad Institute, which Affymetrix has validated and supports for use with the SNP 6.0 array. APT also implements the BRLMM-P algorithm, which Affymetrix has validated and supports for the SNP 5.0 array.</p>
<p>Additionally, a newer version of Birdseed accessed using --analysis birdseed-v2 option and the latest development edition of the Birdseed algorithm accessed via the use of the --analysis birdseed-dev option are implemented. Affymetrix is not currently supporting the newer birdseed-v2 and birdseed-dev methods, in contrast with the supported methods described above. Moreover, the SNP priors and lists of "qualified" SNPs for Birdseed-dev are not currently available from Affymetrix for either SNP 5.0 or 6.0. Further information and support files for Birdseed-dev and Birdseed-v2 are available from the Broad Institute (<a href="http://www.broad.mit.edu/mpg/birdsuite/">http://www.broad.mit.edu/mpg/birdsuite/</a>).</p>
<p>Future APT updates are expected to migrate improvements currently available via the birdseed-dev option into methods supported in the same manner as the rest of APT methods</p>
<p>As birdseed, brlmm and brlmm-p are model based algorithms they need to be run on multiple CEL files at once to estimate probe effect and SNP cluster parameters. For Mapping 500K data it is advisable to run on at least 50 distinct samples (excluding replicates) and ideally on about 100. For Genome-Wide Human SNP 5.0 and 6.0 arrays it is advisable to cluster with at least 44 genetically distinct samples, though adding more will continue to be of benefit in particular for correctly calling rare genotypes.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="quickstart"></a> </p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="QuickStart"></a>
Quick Start</h2>
<p>We illustrate the most basic way to run apt-probeset-genotype with some examples.</p>
<p>The basic requirements for a run of apt-probeset-genotype are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A collection of CEL files to process. Note that the program will run <em>much faster</em> if the CEL files are located on a local disk as opposed to being read across a network. For better overall performance it is advisable to filter CEL files, running the analysis only on those passing a certain specification based on the per-sample QC metric. For Mapping 500K data the recommended per-chip spec is a call rate of 93% using DM at a threshold of 0.33. For Genome-Wide Human SNP 5.0 and 6.0 chips the corresponding qc threshold is a QC call rate of at least 86%.</li>
<li>The CDF file corresponding to the array type of the CELs. CDF files can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/libraryfilesmain.affx">http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/libraryfilesmain.affx</a></li>
<li>A chrX (500K, GenomeWide SNP 5.0) file consisting of the SNP IDs for all non-pseudo-autosomal chrX SNPs on the array. These files can be downloaded from the Affymetrix product page at <a href="http://www.affymetrix.com">http://www.affymetrix.com</a></li>
<li>A specialSNPs (GenomeWide SNP 6.0) file consisting of the SNP IDs for all SNPs with non-diploid copy number (chrX, chrY, Mitochondria). These files can be downloaded from the Affymetrix product page at <a href="http://www.affymetrix.com">http://www.affymetrix.com</a></li>
<li>For Birdseed, BRLMM-P, and BRLMM-P Plus a model file consisting of SNP-specific priors specifying for each SNP where the 3 genotype clusters are likely to be located.</li>
<li>A directory where results will be stored. For this example it is called 'results_dir'</li>
</ul>
<p>WARNING: apt-probeset-genotype will overwrite any existing output files it finds. If you wish to keep existing results make sure to specify a different output directory name.</p>
<p>WARNING: Model files are algorithm specific. Birdseed model files must be used with the Birdseed analysis method and BRLMM-P model files with the brlmm-p method.</p>
<p>NOTE: On windows the DOS prompt does not support wildcard expansion and the preferred method is to supply a text file with the path to the cel files via the '--cel-files' option (see below for details of file format).</p>
<p>NOTE: The windows DOS prompt also does not allow a continuation of a command with the '\' character, unlike unix. So in the examples below the '\' character should be omitted and everything entered on a single line.</p>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="subset"></a>
Analyzing a subset of the SNPs</h2>
<p>Building upon the examples above, here is an example in which only a subset of SNPs are analyzed and the results are written to a text table of genotype calls and a text table of call confidences. The subset of SNPs to be analyzed is specified in a tab-delimited text file called subset_sty.txt, which must contain a column named 'probeset_id'.</p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
apt-probeset-genotype \
  -s subset_sty.txt \
  -c Mapping250K_Sty.cdf \
  --chrX-snps Mapping250K_Sty.chrx \
  -o results_dir \
  --list-sample \
  *.CEL
</pre></div><p>Note: Note that the --list-sample option is required when subsets are used with the (default) BRLMM analyses and should be omitted for other analysis types. For BRLMM, by default the number of probes used for generating priors is 10,000. If a subset of less than 10,000 probes is used, use the --prior-size option to specify a number less than or equall to the subset size.</p>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="chpFiles"></a>
A note about the CHP file format</h2>
<p>In previous versions of apt-probeset-genotype the default output format for genotype calls was the XDA CHP format (also known as GCOS CHP format). For the GenomeWide SNP 5.0, SNP 6.0 and subsequent WGSA products the use of the XDA CHP format is strongly discouraged, instead we recommend the newer AGCC CHP format. To help avoid accidental use of the XDA CHP format the defaults for output format have been changed to produce tab-delimited text tables of calls and confidences. The creation of the text table output can be supressed with the --no-table-output option and the two CHP output formats can be selected with the --xda-chp-output and --cc-chp-output options.</p>
<p>The reason that the XDA CHP format is discouraged for the GenomeWide SNP 5.0 chips is that it doesn't contain entries for SNP IDs, the identity of a SNP is inferred from its order in the file. In the case of the GenomeWide SNP 5.0 chips there are some SNPs that are not part of the default library file which some advanced users may choose to explore. This leads to the possibility of generating CHP files containing different SNP lists, something not well supported by the XDA CHP format. The AGCC CHP format has a slot for SNP IDs and thus is safer to use with chips for which users may be looking at different SNP lists.</p>
<p>For SNP 6.0 XDA CHP file format output is not allowed at all.</p>
<p>Details on the contents of the CHP files for various calling algorithms can be found <a href="#chpformat">below</a>, and a full description of the XDA and AGCC CHP formats can be found in a <a href="gcos-agcc/index.html">local copy</a> of the Affymetrix Developer's Network file format documentation.</p>

                        as described in Irizarry et al 2003. 
   quant-norm           Class for doing quantile normalization. Can 
                        do sketch and full quantile (just set sketch
                        to chip size or zero) and supports
                        bioconductor compatibility. 
   artifact-reduction   Class for artifact reduction. 
   med-norm             Class for doing median normalization. Adjust
                        intensities such that all chips have the same
                        median (or average).

   intensity-reporter   Class for dumping intensity values to a file. 
   no-trans             Placeholder chipstream that does no
                        transformation 

Pm Intensity Adjustments:
   pm-only   No adjustment. Just uses unmodified PM intensity values. 
   pm-mm     Use mismatch probe as adjustment for perfect match. Has
             strength of being unbiased, but often the mismatch probe
             binds the match target. 
   pm-gcbg   Do an adjustment based on the median intensity of probes
             with similar GC content. 
   pm-sum    Add itensity of PM probe for other allele to PM probes. 

Quantification Methods:
   plier        The PLIER (Probe Logarithmic Error Intensity 
                Estimate) method produces an improved signal by
                accounting for experimentally observed patterns in
                feature behavior and handling error at the
                appropriately at low and high signal values. This
                version of PLIER differs from the previous version by
                the addition of a SafteyZero, NumericalTolerance, and
                FixPrecomputed. These options are intended to improve
                the stability of PLIER results when using precomputed
                feature reponse values. To get the older PLIER
                behavior set SafetyZero to 0.0, NumericalTolerance to
                0.0, and FixPrecomputed to false. 
   sea          The SEA (Simplified Expression Analysis) method
                provides a simple signal estimate, using the
                initialization algorithm from the PLIER (Probe
                Logarithmic Error Intensity Estimate) method and
                omitting the PLIER parameter fitting. SEA is useful
                for single chip signal estimation. The version of
                PLIER used by SEA differs from the previous version 
                by the addition of a SafteyZero, NumericalTolerance,
                and FixPrecomputed. These options are intended to
                improve the stability of PLIER results when using
                precomputed feature reponse values. To get the older
                PLIER behavior set SafetyZero to 0.0,
                NumericalTolerance to 0.0, and FixPrecomputed to
                false. 
   iter-plier   Do probe set quantification estimate by iteratively
                calling PLIER with the probes that best correlate 
                with signal estimate. The version of PLIER used by
                IterPLIER differs from the previous version by the
                addition of a SafteyZero, NumericalTolerance, and
                FixPrecomputed. These options are intended to improve
                the stability of PLIER results when using precomputed
                feature reponse values. To get the older PLIER
                behavior set SafetyZero to 0.0, NumericalTolerance to
                0.0, and FixPrecomputed to false. 
   med-polish   Performs a median polish to estimate target and probe
                effects. Resulting summaries are in log2 space by
                default. Used in summary step of RMA as described in
                Irizarry et al 2003. 
   dabg         Calculates the p-value that the intensities in a
                probeset could have been observed by chance in a
                background distribution. Used as a substitute for
                standard absent/present calls when mismatch probes 
                are not available. 
   avgdiff      Calculates the average measurement for a probeset
                using the MAS 4 average difference algorithm, namely
                the average difference between the pm and mm probe
                signal. 
   median       Use the median of probes for a particular chip as the
                summary. 

Analysis Streams:
   expr           Does expression summarization on probesets. 
   pca-select     Determines PCA for probes and picks probes that are
                  near the principal component as the probes to use
                  for downstream analysis. 
   spect-select   Picks probes that are similar to each other based 
                  on spectral cluster and normalized cut.

Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p>Q. What is a probe_id?</p>
<p>A. See the <a href="FAQ.html#probe_id_faq">FAQ item on probe IDs</a> for more info.</p>
<p>Q. The program died with an error message like "Assertion failed: A-&gt;probes.size()
   == 2, file ../DmListener.cpp." What does this mean?</p>
<p>A. This is symptomatic of trying to run BRLMM for a SNP with no MM probes. In its typical mode of running BRLMM relies on DM to generate intital seed calls, and the DM algorithm requires MM probes.</p>
<p>Q. The program died with an error message like "DmListener::getGenoCall() - Can't find
   genotypes for name: SNP_A-1780432". What does this mean?</p>
<p>A. This is symptomatic of having specified the wrong chrX file for the analysis. In order to reduce the likelihood of accidentally using the wrong chrX file apt-probeset-genotype checks to make sure that all the SNPs specified in the chrX file are present on the chips being analyzed. If it finds a SNP present in the chrX file that is not identified in the CDF file it will die with the above message. Note that if you want to bypass the requirement of a chrX file you can use the --no-gender-force option.</p>
<p>Q. The program died and I got an error message saying "Killed". What does this mean and what can I do?</p>
<p>A. Linux has a "feature" that it will promise more memory than it actually has in the hope that many programs won't actually be using all their memory at once. However, if linux does run short of memory it will start killing programs arbitrarily. You can read more about linux's OOM (out of memory) killer at at <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/104179/">LWN.net</a>.</p>
<p>Q. Why does apt-probeset-genotype require information regarding SNPs on chromosomes X/Y/Mito?</p>
<p>A. The SNPs on chromosome X are evaluated separately for XX (female) and XY (male) individuals as the intensity estimates for the males will generally be lower on X due to one missing chromosome. The prior is also adjusted to remove the het center as XY individuals should only have hom calls on the X chromosome. For BRLMM analyses gender is estimated using the method employed in the GTYPE software: individuals are called male if less than 7.5% of the snps on X are called as hets by the initial DM calls using a .33 confidence threshold. For BRLMM-P gender is estimated by use of an Expectation Maximiation (EM) algorithm on the PM probes for chrX SNPs to estimate the het rate.</p>
<p>Q. How is the mask section in the CEL file used?</p>
<p>A. It is not. The contents of this section of the CEL file are ignored.</p>
<p>Q. How can I find out more information about the analysis string: </p>
<pre>
    quant-norm.sketch=50000,pm-only,brlmm-p.CM=1.bins=100.K=2.SB=0.003.MS=0.05
</pre><p>A. Start with the included manual for apt-probeset-genotype. Usage information is also provided if you run apt-probeset-genotype without any arguments. Lastly, use the "--explain" option for more information about particular analysis methods. IE: </p>
<pre>
    apt-probeset-genotype --explain brlmm-p
</pre><p>Q. Wild cards do not work on windows. For example: </p>
<pre>
    apt-probeset-genotype ... *.CEL
</pre><p>A. APT relies on the command shell to do the wild card expansion (ie bash shell on NIX systems). The windows shell does not do wild card expansion, so there is no wild card expansion for APT when run from the windows shell. You may want to try a different windows shell or perhaps bash via cygwin. See the --cel-files option as an alternative to specify CEL files for analysis.</p>

CHP File format.</h3>
<p>This section explains the contents of CHP files for the various algorithms. For details on the formats or for an explanation of why the XDA CHP format is not supported for some chip types, see <a href="#quickstartchpfiles">above</a>.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" id="chpFormatXDA"></a>
XDA CHP file format</h4>
<p>The XDA CHP file format is only supported for the BRLMM algorithm applied to the 100K or 500K arrays. Historically the genotyping XDA CHP file is closely tied to the DM model and while BRLMM uses the same format for backward compatibility it is important to note that the interpretation of some fields is different. Below are the names of the fields and corresponding BRLMM values that are stored in them.</p>
<ul>
<li>GenotypeCall: (6,7,8,11) correspond to (AA,BB,AB,NoCall) respectively.</li>
<li>Confidence: Value between 0 and 1. The ratio of the distance to the closest cluster to the second closest cluster. Lower values are more confident.</li>
<li>pvalue_AA: Mahalanobis distance to AA cluster.</li>
<li>pvalue_AB: Mahalanobis distance to AB cluster.</li>
<li>pvalue_BB: Mahalanobis distance to BB cluster.</li>
<li>pvalue_NN: Not valid for BRLMM, value FLT_MAX inserted as placeholder.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following parameters are saved in the CCHPFileHeader object:</p>
<ul>
<li>het-mult: Het multiplier.</li>
<li>iterations: Number of BRLMM iterations.</li>
<li>iter-thresh: Maximum score used during BRLMM iterations.</li>
<li>K: Scaling parameter in transformations.</li>
<li>transform: Which transformation was used for A &amp; B allele.</li>
<li>prior-weight: Number of pseudocounts used as weight for prior.</li>
<li>prior-mincall: Minimum number of observations for seeing each AA,AB,BB cluster to be used in prior. Minimum is 2 as can't get variance for less than 2.</li>
<li>lowprecision: Were summary values rounded off before transforming. This is only used for regression testing to be compatible with an R prototype.</li>
</ul>
<p>A complete explanation of the XDA CHP file format can be found in a <a href="gcos-agcc/index.html">local copy</a> of the Affymetrix Developer's Network file format documentation.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" id="chpFormatAGCC"></a>
AGCC CHP file format</h4>
<p>The AGCC CHP format consists of a header followed by a data section. The header section contains a large amount of information including the software version and the full set of parameters used in the clustering analysis. The data section consists of a matrix with a row for each SNP. The columns are:</p>
<ul>
<li>probeset_id: The SNP identifier. SNPs with the "AFFX" prefix are control SNPs.</li>
<li>genotype_call: (6,7,8,11) correspond to (AA,BB,AB,NoCall) respectively.</li>
<li>genotype_confidence: for BRLMM, BRLMM-P and Birdseed this is a value between 0 and 1, with lower values corresponding to greater confidence.</li>
<li>clustering_space_x_value: x value for plotting sample in clustering space.</li>
<li>clustering_space_y_value: y value for plotting sample in clustering space.</li>
<li>forced_call: reveals what the call would have been had no threshold on genotype_confidence been applied.</li>
</ul>
<p>Use of the clustering_space_x_value and clustering_space_y_value fields allows for plotting the data in the space that was used to perform the clustering. For BRLMM and BRLMM-P the x-value is 'transformed contrast' and the y-value is 'signal strength' - see the <a href="http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/whitepapers/brlmm_whitepaper.pdf">BRLMM</a> and <a href="http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/whitepapers/brlmmp_whitepaper.pdf">BRLMM-P</a> whitepapers for more detail. For Birdseed (see <a href="http://www.broad.mit.edu/mpg/birdsuite/">http://www.broad.mit.edu/mpg/birdsuite/</a>) this is A-signal va B-signal (linear scale, post quantile normalization and allele-specific median-polish).</p>

Custom Analyses:</h3>
<p>While aliases for common analysis such as brlmm with default parameters are provided it is possible to construct custom analyses on the command line. There are both program options and analysis parameters that can be set to affect the results. Most people are familiar with the standard method for setting program options, but the specification of the analysis method and its parameters in apt-probeset-genotype works a little differently. The method for setting custom parameters to the analysis involves supplying a text representation of the analysis and parameters desired. This enables flexibility as each piece of an analysis is self-contained and they can be (almost) arbitrarily combined. Note that when using a custom analysis rather than an alias it is necessary to specify the entire analysis and not acceptable to pass custom parameters to the alias. For example, if you wanted to change the number of iterations brlmm performs you would have to specify 'quant-norm.sketch=50000,pm-only,brlmm.iterations=1' rather than just typing 'brlmm.iterations=1'</p>
<p>The current full default brlmm analysis is: 'quant-norm.sketch=50000,pm-only,brlmm' where there can be multiple chipstream modules (in this case a single quant-norm) separated by commas and the last two entries are the pm adjuster (pm-only) and quantification method (brlmm). Parameters to a particular step in the analysis are supplied in key=value pairs and separated by periods. For example 'quant-norm.sketch=50000' indicates that the chips should be quantile normalized and that a sketch (subset of total data) of size 50000 should be used to do the normalization. Using a sketch can significantly reduce the amount of memory needed with minimal impact on normalization values. To do quantile normalization with just the PM probes and resolve ties in the same manner as bioconductor's RMA version of quantile normalization you would specify 'quant-norm.sketch=50000.bioc=true.usepm=true'. All of the parameters possible can be seen by using the --explain option in conjunction with the name of the module (i.e. apt-probeset-genotype --explain quant-norm).</p>
<p>So a few examples custom analyses would be:</p>
<p>'pm-only,brlmm.transform=rvt' - No normalization, use rvt space for clustering in blrmm.</p>
<p>'med-norm,pm-mm,brlmm.het-mult=.9' - Do a median normalization, use a PM-MM adjustment for probes and a het multiplier of .9 to try and balance hom/het calls.</p>
<p>'rma-bg,quant-norm.sketch=50000.usepm=true.bioc=true,pm-only,blrmm.K=4.tranform=CCS' - Do an RMA style quantile normalization using a subset of 50000 data points followed by brlmm in CCS (contrast centers space) space with K = 4.</p>

Clustering Space Transformations:</h3>
<p>There are a number of different transformations that are implemented for different spaces which can be specified via the transform parameter to brlmm and are detailed below. For all of these transformations <img class="formulaInl" alt="$A$" src="form_3.png"/> and <img class="formulaInl" alt="$B$" src="form_4.png"/> denote the intensity of the A and B alleles respectively as estimated by the quantification method (such as plier or RMA). <img class="formulaInl" alt="$X$" src="form_5.png"/> and <img class="formulaInl" alt="$Y$" src="form_6.png"/> denote the new coordinates that <img class="formulaInl" alt="$A$" src="form_3.png"/> and <img class="formulaInl" alt="$B$" src="form_4.png"/> will be transformed into.</p>
