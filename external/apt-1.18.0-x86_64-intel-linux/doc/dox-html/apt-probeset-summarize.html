Introduction</h2>
<p><code>apt-probeset-summarize</code> is a program for doing background subtraction, normalization and summarizing probe sets from Affymetrix expression microarrays. It implements analysis algorithms such as <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus&amp;list_uids=12582260&amp;query_hl=2&amp;itool=pubmed_docsum">RMA</a>, <a href="http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/technotes/plier_technote.pdf">Plier</a>, and DABG (detected above background).</p>
<p>The main features of apt-probeset-summarize not common in other implementations are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quantile normalization using a subset (sketch) of the data which results in much smaller memory usage.</li>
<li>Analyze microarray in chunks of probesets, which when combined with the sketch quantile normalization above allows the analysis thousands of chips on a single computer or in parallel across a cluster of computers.</li>
<li>Save target normalizations and probe (feature) effects for use later.</li>
<li>Ability to group probesets into larger "meta" probesets as specified by the user via a text file. This is particularly for the exon level microarrays where gene or transcript level estimates are desired.</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="anchor" id="quickstart"></a> </p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="QuickStart"></a>
Quick Start</h2>
<p>Most users will just want to generate summaries using RMA and/or Plier for each probeset on the microarray. We provide both 'rma' and 'rma-sketch' where 'rma-sketch' will closely approximate a full quantile normalization using a much smaller amount of memory.</p>
<p>On unix systems a command to do both rma-sketch and plier-sketch analysis at the same time with the default parameters looks like:</p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
apt-probeset-summarize -a rma-sketch -a plier-mm-sketch -d chip.cdf -o output-dir *.cel
</pre></div><p>when using a CDF file or alternatively a PGF and CLF files can be specified:</p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
apt-probeset-summarize -a rma-sketch -a plier-mm-sketch -p chip.pgf -c chip.clf -o output-dir *.cel
</pre></div><p>As the windows command prompt does not natively support wild card expansion the preferred method is to supply a text file list via the --cel-files option (see below for details of file format). A windows a command using the default parameters looks like:</p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
apt-probeset-summarize -a rma-sketch -a plier-mm-sketch -d chip.cdf -o output-dir --cel-files cel_list.txt
</pre></div><p>Where <code>-a</code> specifies an analysis to do and <code>-o</code> specifies a directory to put the output files in. You can specify the probesets on a chip with either a CDF file via a <code>-d</code> or using a PGF/CLF file pair via the <code>-p</code> and <code>-c</code> flags.</p>
<p>If the microarray does not have mismatch probes you can specify use a surrogate mismatch based on probes with similar GC content by using the <code>plier-gcbg</code> analysis and specifying the background probes using the --bgp-file flag.</p>
<p>WARNING: apt-probeset-summarize will overwrite any existing output files it finds. If you wish to keep existing results make sure to specify a different output directory name. It is also important to note that consistent with the Bioconductor implementation all RMA output has been log2 transformed.</p>

                          'quant-norm,pm-gcbg,plier'. Prepackaged
                          analysis such as 'plier-gcbg-sketch',

                          similar analysis (i.e. feature effects for
                          pm-only may be different than for pm-mm).
                          Currently a probe is expected to be in only
                          a single probeset. This option does not 
                          work for IterPlier or SEA. [default ''] 
     --feat-details Output probe by chip specific details

                          If more than one -a option generates a
                          target sketch file, it is not deterministic
                          which file will be retained by the OS if

                        as described in Irizarry et al 2003. 
   quant-norm           Class for doing quantile normalization. Can 
                        do sketch and full quantile (just set sketch

   no-trans             Placeholder chipstream that does no
                        transformation 

Pm Intensity Adjustments:
   pm-only   No adjustment. Just uses unmodified PM intensity values. 
   pm-mm     Use mismatch probe as adjustment for perfect match. Has
             strength of being unbiased, but often the mismatch probe
             binds the match target. 
   pm-gcbg   Do an adjustment based on the median intensity of probes
             with similar GC content. 
   pm-sum    Add itensity of PM probe for other allele to PM probes. 

Quantification Methods:
   plier        The PLIER (Probe Logarithmic Error Intensity 
                Estimate) method produces an improved signal by
                accounting for experimentally observed patterns in
                feature behavior and handling error at the
                appropriately at low and high signal values. This
                version of PLIER differs from the previous version by
                the addition of a SafteyZero, NumericalTolerance, and
                FixPrecomputed. These options are intended to improve
                the stability of PLIER results when using precomputed
                feature reponse values. To get the older PLIER
                behavior set SafetyZero to 0.0, NumericalTolerance to
                0.0, and FixPrecomputed to false. 
   sea          The SEA (Simplified Expression Analysis) method
                provides a simple signal estimate, using the
                initialization algorithm from the PLIER (Probe
                Logarithmic Error Intensity Estimate) method and
                omitting the PLIER parameter fitting. SEA is useful
                for single chip signal estimation. The version of
                PLIER used by SEA differs from the previous version 
                by the addition of a SafteyZero, NumericalTolerance,
                and FixPrecomputed. These options are intended to
                improve the stability of PLIER results when using
                precomputed feature reponse values. To get the older
                PLIER behavior set SafetyZero to 0.0,
                NumericalTolerance to 0.0, and FixPrecomputed to
                false. 
   iter-plier   Do probe set quantification estimate by iteratively
                calling PLIER with the probes that best correlate 
                with signal estimate. The version of PLIER used by
                IterPLIER differs from the previous version by the
                addition of a SafteyZero, NumericalTolerance, and
                FixPrecomputed. These options are intended to improve
                the stability of PLIER results when using precomputed
                feature reponse values. To get the older PLIER
                behavior set SafetyZero to 0.0, NumericalTolerance to
                0.0, and FixPrecomputed to false. 
   med-polish   Performs a median polish to estimate target and probe
                effects. Resulting summaries are in log2 space by
                default. Used in summary step of RMA as described in
                Irizarry et al 2003. 
   dabg         Calculates the p-value that the intensities in a
                probeset could have been observed by chance in a
                background distribution. Used as a substitute for
                standard absent/present calls when mismatch probes 
                are not available. 
   avgdiff      Calculates the average measurement for a probeset
                using the MAS 4 average difference algorithm, namely
                the average difference between the pm and mm probe
                signal. 
   median       Use the median of probes for a particular chip as the
                summary. 

Analysis Streams:
   expr           Does expression summarization on probesets. 
   pca-select     Determines PCA for probes and picks probes that are
                  near the principal component as the probes to use
                  for downstream analysis. 
   spect-select   Picks probes that are similar to each other based 
                  on spectral cluster and normalized cut.

A Word about Program Options vs Analysis Parameters:</h3>
<p>The results generated by apt-probeset-genotype can be affected by both the program level <b>options</b> (like --target-sketch, --meta-probesets, --bgp-file) and the analysis <b>parameters</b> used to create an analysis specification as supplied via the --analysis option (like quant-norm.usepm=true.bioc=true,pm-only,med-polish). The analysis level parameters are aimed at advanced users and others are encouraged to stick with the "Standard Methods" described above in the <a href="#options">Options</a> section.</p>
<p>The ability to specify parameters to an analysis via the analysis specification provides a powerful mechanism to construct custom analysis, but can be confusing at first as the output from most programs is controlled only by the program level options. In spirit the ability to specify analysis level parameters is analogous to providing a custom regular expression to the unix program 'grep'. The available parameters for a particular step of an analysis can be seen using the --explain option (i.e. apt-probeset-summarize --explain quant-norm). See <a href="#analysisSpecification">below</a> for details on the comma and period separated format.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="concepts"></a> </p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="manualConcepts"></a>
Some Concepts:</h3>
<p>An analysis of Affymetrix microarrays usually starts with some combination of background subtraction, normalization, and summarization of all the probes from a particular probeset. There are a variety of different methods to perform each one of these steps. apt-probeset-summarize aims to provide a flexible way to specify an analysis and compute them efficiently. Key concepts for understanding what apt-probeset-summarize does and how it does it are:</p>
<ul>
<li>RMA alias analysis is: 'rma-bg,quant-norm.sketch=0.usepm=true.bioc=true,pm-only,med-polish' which is a comma separated list of different analysis modules making up the analysis specification. Every analysis portion must terminate with a PM modification module (pm-only in this case) and a probeset summarization step (med-polish in this case).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Probeset Specification: Probesets must be specified either using a combination of PGF and CLF files or a single CDF file. As CDF files don't usually have sequences in them it is not possible to use the GC background model with CDF files.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Meta Probesets: It is possible to define meta probesets which are the combination of multiple probesets by specifying a 'probeset_list' column in addition to the usual 'probeset_id' column in the 'probeset-ids' file. This of particular interest for the Exon microarray as the individual exon probesets can be put together to generate a transcript level estimate.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Full Quantile vs Sketch Quantile: A full quantile normalization is generally memory intensive as the typical implementation loads the all of the data for all of the chips into memory. It is possible to use a subsample, or sketch, of the data to approximate the full quantile normalization. Thus, using a sketch normalization means that you are no longer limited by the number of chips that you wish to analyze, but rather by the number of probesets that you wish to analyze at once.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Analyzing a subset of probesets: It is possible to divide an individual analysis run into smaller jobs by specifying a subset of probesets to analyze via the 'probeset-ids' file.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Using a surrogate mismatch: Some chips don't have a specific MM probe, instead they have thousands of probes that shouldn't hybridize to anything else in the genome. These background probes are used to estimate a surrogate mismatch probe value. Using these background probes to generate more sophisticated background models is an area of active research.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a class="anchor" id="manualAnalysis"></a>
Custom Analysis Specification:</h3>
<p>As discussed above an analysis specification via a comma separated list of different analysis modules making up the analysis. Every analysis path must terminate with a PM modification module (i.e. pm-only or pm-mm) and a probeset summarization step (i.e. median polish for RMA the analysis specification 'quant-norm.sketch=0.usepm=true.bioc=true' means the 'sketch=0' parameter indicate sketch size should be all the data, 'usepm=true' indicates that only the perfect match probes should be used for normalization, and 'bioc=true' means that the Bioconductor method of resolving ties in the quantile normalization should be used.</p>
<p>As an example, RMA style analysis, but with a linear normalization instead of the more aggressive quantile the analysis specification would look like: 'rma-bg,med-norm,pm-only,med-polish'</p>
<p>They types of data transformations, PM intensity adjustments, and quantification methods supported by apt-probeset-summarize can be seen by calling apt-probeset-summarize with the --help flag. The parameters available for a particular method can be seen by calling apt-probeset-summarize with the --explain flag (i.e. --explain quant-norm)</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="normalization"></a> </p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="manNorm"></a>
Normalization:</h3>
<p>Normalization is one of those topics where one can get 10 different opinions from 10 different people. The focus of this section is not to tell you which normalization method to use, but rather to alert you to some of the potential pitfalls in implementation.</p>
<p>Quantile normalization makes the entire distribution of data from different chips the same. One of the first steps of doing a quantile normalization is to sort the data from the chip. This leads to an implementation issue of what to do when ties occur (which often happens). The Bioconductor normalize.quantile() function from the affy package resolves ties by setting all the ties to have the value of the data point at the middle of the run of ties. The limma package has a function called normalizeQuantiles() that by default arbitrarily breaks ties by ignoring the fact that they are occurring. If the ties=TRUE flag is set normalizeQuantiles() will do the mathematically "correct" thing and use the average value of all of the ties as the final value to use, but incurs a significant slowdown in run time. By default the apt-probeset-summarize implementation does the mathematically correct method of taking the average of all the tied values, but has been optimized to not incur a significant performance cost. For compatibility with the RMA method in Bioconductor the quant-norm module in apt-probeset-summarize has an optional parameter 'bioc' which can be set to true to get the normalize.quantiles() version of quantile normalization.</p>
<p>A full quantile normalization is generally memory intensive as the typical implementation loads the all of the data for all of the chips into memory. It is possible to use a subsample, or sketch, of the data to approximate the full quantile normalization. As we expect the data to be continuous we use linear interpolation when a data point falls in between the samples in the sketch. In practice, the sketch approximation is very close to the full quantile as long as sketch is reasonably dense (default to 1% of probes or 50,000 data points, whichever is larger). Thus, using a sketch normalization means that you are no longer limited by the number of chips that you wish to analyze, but rather by the number of probesets that you wish to analyze at once.</p>
<p>Linear normalization doesn't have as many implementation pitfalls as quantile normalization, but the determination of the target value to adjust the arrays to and the summary metric for an array can vary from method to method. Sometimes the summary metric used is the average and other times the median is used. The target value to adjust the chips to is sometimes generated by designating one chip as the 'reference chip' and adjusting all the other chips linearly to have the same mean (or median) as the reference chip. Another approach is to calculate a summary value from all of the chips (i.e. a virtual average chip). By default apt-probeset-summarize will normalize all the chips to the median value of the medians from each chip. One gotcha with any linear normalization is to make sure that you are normalizing to the signal of the array and not the background. This is especially true for arrays with a large number of speculative content such as tiling arrays and the exon array.</p>

Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p>Q. What do I do when I don't have enough memory to process all the data?</p>
<p>A. You can use a sketch quantile normalization rather than full quantile normalization. For example, using 'rma-sketch' (via --analysis option) instead of 'rma' will significantly reduce memory footprint while having a minimal impact on the results.</p>
<p>Q. I get slightly different value than RMA using the PGF file rather than the CDF file, why is that?</p>
<p>A. The CDF file excludes certain probesets that are contained in the PGF file. The inclusion of these probes changes slightly the RMA background subtraction parameters and the normalization results to produce slightly different results, which should not be significant.</p>
<p>Q. I get slightly different values with Plier when I use the precomputed feature effects than when I learn them on the same data set, Why is that?</p>
<p>A. Plier is an iterative algorithm that stops searching for a better solution once a "good" fit has been found. When the feature effects are specified rather than learned the fit may be slightly different, but in the view of plier it is just as "good" as the original fit.</p>
<p>Q. How do I get probe level (rather than probeset level) p-values from dabg?</p>
<p>A. Use the --feature-details option. For most methods --feature-details outputs the residuals, but for dabg it will output the probe level p-values.</p>
<p>Q. How do I get more precision in the output than the 3 decimal places provided?</p>
<p>A. Use the --precision option to get more precision to the program. this will result in larger text files.</p>
<p>Q. Can I get more precision especially for dabg as I need to set a low threshold to address multiple testing concerns?</p>
<p>A. Try using the 'neglog10' parameter with dabg which will report -1 * log_10(p-value). See 'apt-probeset-summarize --explain dabg' for details, but an example analysis specification would be: '--analysis pm-only,dabg.neglog10=true'</p>
<p>Q. The output using RMA looks odd, Why are the values so small (in 0-16 range)? Plier and Mas5 give much larger values.</p>
<p>A. As with the original RMA analysis specification of '--analysis rma' which is a alias for '--analysis rma-bg,quant-norm.sketch=0.usepm=true.bioc=true,pm-only,med-polish' to '--analysis rma-bg,quant-norm.sketch=0.usepm=true.bioc=true,pm-only,med-polish.expon=true' (note the small expon=true at end of specification).</p>
<p>Q. I get the an error, "Error: Didn't find required column: 'cel_files' in file: 'cel_file_groups.tsv'", when using apt-probeset-summarize with data previous analyzed using ExACT.</p>
<p>A. apt-probeset-summarize expects the list of cel file names (provided with the --cel-files option) to have a header, "cel_files". ExACT expected/generated a header value of "cel_file". To use your ExACT cel file listing files with APT you will need to remove the "s" from "cel_files" in the header.</p>
<p>Q. I get slightly different answers when I normalize with exact-normalize.pl and then generate summary estimates vs. normalizing directly with apt-probeset-summarize - what is going on?</p>
<p>A. When exact-normalize.pl writes the normalized values to cel files the floating point values are truncated for storage reasons. If you use XDA as the output format and specify 'lowprecision=true' to the apt-probeset-summarize normalization modules (i.e. rma-bg,quant-norm.lowprecision=true,pm-gcbg,plier') you should get the same values.</p>
<p>Q. Where can I get more information on the pca-select feature?</p>
<p>A. Currently there is a talk from at the Affymetrix Low Level Dynamically Selecting Probes for Gene-Level Expression Estimates Using a Principal Components Based Approach</p>
<p>Q. How is the mask section in the CEL file used?</p>
<p>A. It is not. The contents of this section of the CEL file are ignored.</p>
<p>Q. How can I find out more information about the analysis string: </p>
<pre>
    rma-bg,quant-norm.sketch=0.usepm=true.bioc=true,pm-only,med-polish
</pre><p>A. Start with the included manual for apt-probeset-summarize. Usage information is also provided if you run apt-probeset-summarize without any arguments. Lastly, use the "--explain" option for more information about particular analysis methods. IE: </p>
<pre>
    apt-probeset-summarize --explain quant-norm.
</pre><p>Q. Wild cards do not work on windows. For example: </p>
<pre>
    apt-probeset-summarize ... *.CEL
</pre><p>A. APT relies on the command shell to do the wild card expansion (ie bash shell on NIX systems). The windows shell does not do wild card expansion, so there is no wild card expansion for APT when run from the windows shell. You may want to try a different windows shell or perhaps bash via cygwin. See the --cel-files option as an alternative to specify CEL files for analysis.</p>
<p>Q. In expression console I can select the option "Scale to all probe sets" and specify a target (e.g. 200). How can I specify this in apt-probeset-summarize ?</p>
<p>Q. Are APT CHP files compatible with EC? Are they identical to what EC generates?</p>
<p>A. See the <a href="VIGNETTE-chp-file-output-differences.html">CHP File Differences between EC, GC, and APT</a> vignette for more information.</p>
<p>Q. Does apt-probeset-summarize generate a quality assessment report like EC?</p>
<p>A. Yes. There will be a report.txt output file (ie rma-sketch.report.txt) which includes many of the same quality assessment metrics.</p>
<p>Q. What happens to non-pm probes when pulled through the rma-bg chipstream?</p>
<p>A. The background parameterization is based only on PM probes. If methods request an intensity value for a non-PM probe, then the probe itensity of that non-PM probe will be background adjusted just as if it were a PM probe. The following is an example of an analysis stream where this would occur:    </p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
        rma-bg,quant-norm,pm-mm,plier
   </pre></div><p> Of course combining the global background correction from RMA with PLIER and a probe specific correction using the MM may result in poor results.</p>
<p>Q. What is a probe_id?</p>
<p>A. See the <a href="FAQ.html#probe_id_faq">FAQ item on probe IDs</a> for more info. </p>
